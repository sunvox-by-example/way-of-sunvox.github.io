      <p><b><i>From one thing, know ten thousand things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see. You must study hard. - Miyamoto Musashi</i></b></p>

      <p>This is a (work in progress) resource for the music creation application <a href="http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/">SunVox</a>.</p>

      <p>It is divided into 4 sections: A tutorial, a how-to, a reference, and a library.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./tutorial/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> guides the user through the music creation process in SunVox, acting as a general introduction and working through the basics. Animated gifs with text descriptions as well as example SunVox projects are provided for reference.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./how-to/how-to.html">how-to</a> is a collection of techniques and stretegies for approaching sound design, routing, organization, and compositions.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./reference/reference.html">reference</a> includes descriptions, documentation, and examples of each type of native module, each type of pattern effect, and documentation for each menu option and preference within the application.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./library/library.html">library</a> is a collection of user created effects and instruments sorted by type/user.</p>

      <p>The name "Way of SunVox" is a reference to the "Way of Strategy" as written by Miyamoto Musashi, the greatest Samurai who ever lived, in his <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/Book_of_Five_Rings_djvu.txt">Book of Five Rings</a>. This final work was dictated by Musashi to his understudy by his deathbed in a cave in 1645, recorded on one complete scroll. Musashi was undefeated in over 30 duels to the death, eventually fighting with wooden kendo swords instead of steel. Upon retiring from dueling, he turned his back on any potential to start a school or enjoy royal patronage in order to live the life of a creative aesthetic. Musashi went on to become one of the greatest artists, poets, philosophers, and musicians in Japan's history. His entire life was dedicated to the way of strategy, forged in battle and then applied to all creative expression.</p>
