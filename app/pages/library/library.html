This is a link to a library of effects and sound generators I've collected and some I've made. All are sorted by type and then by user. The files themselves are saved in sunsynth format (for a description of sunsynth files see <a href="https://way-of-sunvox.github.io/how-to/get-started/save-and-load/save-and-load.html">How to Save and Load Files</a>). I've saved this to github, you can take a look <a href="https://github.com/way-of-sunvox/way-of-sunvox-library.git">here</a> and view the directory, where you can either download individual files or the entire collection (see the green "clone or download" button.)
