      <p><i>Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in rhythm only
        if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts, shooting bows
        and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and abilities there is timing.</i></p>
      <p><i>There is also timing in the Void. - Miyamoto Musashi</i></p>

        <p>SunVox is a modular sound design environment with a tracker based sequencer. The sound design environment is modular much in the same way as a modular synthesizer, but its capabilities extend beyond what you might expect from a modular synth. The tracker based sequencer is derived from the original tracker based sequencers (Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64) which predated modern day DAWs (Ableton, Logic, etc.) A tracker based approach however still holds many advantages over the more modern graphical approaches. If you dislike the reliance on the mouse that comes with working in a DAW, you will appreciate a tracker based workflow. In some ways you could compare working in a DAW with your computer's GUI (ie. the finder on a MAC) and working in SunVox with working on the command line (ie. Terminal).</p>

        <p>SunVox is unconventional, spartan, fast, efficient, and very powerful. It is not easy, but it is simple, which is far more useful as well as more difficult to achieve. The user needs to surrender to and accept it to to become productive with it, but once there, you can do things that are not possible in other music making environments.</p>

        <p>SunVox is also the most powerful fully portable music making application there is. You can work on a SunVox project on your top of the line laptop, then open and work on that same session on your phone. SunVox will [adjust its engine](http://www.warmplace.ru/wiki/doku.php?id=sunvox:manual_en#comparison_of_different_versions) for CPU efficiency based on the host technology, and given it is already ultra efficient, its pretty incredible how much SunVox lets you get done on portable/touch screen formats.</p>

        <p>Anyone can learn SunVox. Currently I am teaching my 7 year old son and he loves it.</p>
